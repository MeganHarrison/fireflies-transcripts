## Transcript
**Bclymer**: It just says formatting and stuff like that.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So that, so that's like comment, right?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, those are my comments.
**Jdawson**: Hi, Brandon.
**Jdawson**: What is it, Ricky?
**Bclymer**: Talk.
**Jdawson**: Nice to meet you.
**Bclymer**: Nice to meet you.
**Bclymer**: And this is the comment from us.
**Bclymer**: The left side.
**Bclymer**: The email from.
**Jdawson**: Correct.
**Jdawson**: That's the.
**Jdawson**: Your email.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: Let's do the easy ones first.
**Bclymer**: The ones that I can probably help with.
**Bclymer**: Can you go to the left?
**Bclymer**: The fixed price contract, section 2.
**Bclymer**: 4.
**Bclymer**: 2.2.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: We have the right to apply interest.
**Bclymer**: We don't pay invoice property provided second notice.
**Bclymer**: Okay, that's.
**Bclymer**: That's fine.
**Bclymer**: Sprinkler drawings or air balance reports.
**Bclymer**: I mean, I assume your sprinkler shop draw, a sprinkler subcontractor is providing shop drawings, right?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: I mean, first of all, there's no H Vac on this job.
**Jdawson**: So what do you want to test and balance?
**Bclymer**: Just strike.
**Bclymer**: That is fine.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: And then as far as the sprinkler drawings and what my comment was initially is like, hey, like we've got fabrication drawings, which you don't want those.
**Jdawson**: But as far as as builts go, you know your engineering firm, Henderson.
**Jdawson**: So if something changes your contract with them, they should put that on a digital file and give you a clean copy.
**Jdawson**: We'll have our field markups if something has to shift in the field, but we're not going to go redraw everything for them.
**Bclymer**: I understand.
**Bclymer**: The sprinkler sub will provide the shop drawing of what's being installed though.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: And if there's any field adjustments, we'll just have to address them.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So let's.
**Jdawson**: But let's be clear on like when you say a shop drawing.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: What shop drawing are you wanting to see of a sprinkler pipe?
**Bclymer**: Like, for example, the engineer will provide the design drawing of the sprinkler layout and specifications.
**Bclymer**: Right?
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Your sprinkler con subcontractor will take those drawings and produce another record set of drawings that they're going to build off of.
**Bclymer**: Is that.
**Jdawson**: No, no.
**Jdawson**: Your Henderson Engineering was contracted.
**Jdawson**: They provided the permit set of drawings.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Jdawson**: That's why at the beginning of this thing when you guys are going to bid and they had the completely wrong table, I came in and said, hey guys, this is designed wrong.
**Jdawson**: This is what it needs to be so that you can save money.
**Jdawson**: Like what we have, those permit drawings were what went.
**Jdawson**: Now what we created is our, you know, quote unquote shop drawings, which is fabrication drawings.
**Jdawson**: Like we go in and have to redo and do our fabrication drawings.
**Jdawson**: But Henderson is doing your calcs and your permit drawings, which are already done.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Well, it's not the same thing.
**Bclymer**: Understood.
**Bclymer**: Okay, that's fine.
**Bclymer**: We just have to change the language then.
**Bclymer**: It's not as built.
**Bclymer**: It's just.
**Jdawson**: It's just keel drawings.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah, that's.
**Bclymer**: It's.
**Bclymer**: It's.
**Bclymer**: To me, it's essentially the same thing.
**Bclymer**: So I think it's just a language thing.
**Bclymer**: Liquidated damages.
**Bclymer**: I can't comment on that.
**Bclymer**: I'll leave it to legal.
**Bclymer**: Comply with their insurance requirements.
**Bclymer**: Ah, that's kind of set.
**Bclymer**: Our insurance requirements are our insurance requirements.
**Bclymer**: I can't.
**Jdawson**: I mean, you guys are requiring us to carry insurance for three years.
**Jdawson**: I'm not going to do that.
**Jdawson**: Like, why would I carry insurance for a building when we're not in it?
**Bclymer**: I don't.
**Bclymer**: I have to talk to Risk about that.
**Bclymer**: I don't.
**Bclymer**: I'm not really well versed in the.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I mean, I.
**Jdawson**: If you want me to take out a policy and hold it for three years, I'll give you a.
**Jdawson**: I'll give you a quote for it.
**Jdawson**: But you know, the.
**Jdawson**: The bid drawings never said, oh, by the way, you're, you know, you're on the hook for three years.
**Jdawson**: Like, otherwise we would have priced that in.
**Bclymer**: Understood.
**Bclymer**: Hey, Yusuke, can you ping Ilana and see if she's going to join?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah.
**Bclymer**: Kevin, can you.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, like, I can do the easy stuff, like number two, number three, but I can't.
**Bclymer**: I can't comment on the rest because it's not my wheelhouse.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so you mean the three years hookup for the insurance part, right?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: That's not me, that's Risk.
**Bclymer**: I.
**Bclymer**: I can't comment on that.
**Bclymer**: I don't.
**Bclymer**: I don't know our policy very as well as they do.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: That's the same column we received from Jesse or something.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, that's where Jesse responded.
**Jdawson**: Because you sent that agreement, it's like we, you know, we're not signing this.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, understood.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So at least we got the sprinkler drawings out of the way.
**Bclymer**: Air balance report does not apply.
**Bclymer**: So you just strike it as built or have their subscribe as built.
**Bclymer**: We'll just.
**Bclymer**: We're just going to call as built fabrication drawings, which is, to me, the same thing.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Perfect.
**Bclymer**: And the rest, I think Christina.
**Bclymer**: Christina from Risk needs to review.
**Bclymer**: Is there any other points in the main contract besides this, or.
**Jdawson**: I mean, I.
**Jdawson**: I sent back, you know, a bunch of markups, so Assuming that everything that's not on here is agreed to.
**Jdawson**: But you know, I wouldn't know.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I mean that's, that's.
**Jdawson**: That's the biggest thing.
**Jdawson**: But I, and again reading through that, a lot of it is fluff and doesn't pertain to us.
**Jdawson**: So I didn't even really worry about it too much.
**Jdawson**: You know, some of the references retail and stores and different components that don't.
**Bclymer**: Even exist, they use the standard agreement from the stores.
**Bclymer**: Because that's mostly our like 99 of our contracts and it was written based off of the AA101 but tailored specifically for a retail store.
**Bclymer**: So I understand like some hesitation to like execute it because it doesn't apply to you.
**Bclymer**: I, I totally understand.
**Jdawson**: Is there any.
**Jdawson**: Scroll down.
**Jdawson**: Is there anything else?
**Bclymer**: Okay, standard conditions 2.2 root original 3.5.
**Bclymer**: I don't know what those mean.
**Bclymer**: Not defined term.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: I guess that replies that relates to some points on the primary contract.
**Bclymer**: Right on the right.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: The, the right of the comments.
**Jdawson**: One thing I would ask John, what is the hang up or I guess hesitation on using an AIA 101?
**Bclymer**: I don't know.
**Bclymer**: I don't know.
**Jdawson**: Makes sense.
**Bclymer**: I mean legal will have to create.
**Bclymer**: Create one.
**Jdawson**: But no, you don't have to create one.
**Jdawson**: You go on the.
**Bclymer**: I mean, I mean like fill it out, you know.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I mean you just fill it out with the language.
**Jdawson**: You know, our company, your company.
**Jdawson**: Like I don't know if you guys ever used them.
**Jdawson**: Like.
**Jdawson**: We've used them.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, all the time.
**Bclymer**: I mean I've previously used them all the time also.
**Bclymer**: But I was also on the arctic side.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: From a.
**Jdawson**: You know, that one specifically is an owner contractor relationship.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, it's this one that covers you know, all the basis.
**Jdawson**: The only things you're filling in are the same information you fill out of any contract, which is who's the two.
**Jdawson**: What's the amount, time frame and what are the.
**Jdawson**: What are the agreed upon documents contracts that you're building to.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Contractor comments.
**Bclymer**: Go back, go back, go back.
**Bclymer**: Let me read the thing.
**Jdawson**: He's wanting to.
**Jdawson**: He's wanting to read the comments on the.
**Bclymer**: Right, right.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: Construction two weeks after permit.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, that's fine.
**Bclymer**: That makes sense.
**Bclymer**: It shall complete the wireless retrieve substantial compute substrature has been authorized by one or no less than almost a year.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Is that the schedule?
**Bclymer**: Almost a year?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: A little bit more than a year.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: The live date is May something.
**Bclymer**: Not May, it's like August something.
**Jdawson**: August something.
**Jdawson**: So a little over a year.
**Bclymer**: Just to be clear, the red is your comments, right?
**Jdawson**: My comments?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: If you look to the right says author, it'll do it.
**Jdawson**: And then the.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Anything that I put on there should show like, like what you're seeing there to the right.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: You scroll down to the other.
**Bclymer**: Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.
**Bclymer**: 6.3.
**Bclymer**: I mean, I can't really comment on the insurance stuff, Brandon.
**Bclymer**: Like that one's a bit difficult.
**Bclymer**: I know that our risk team is quite adamant about the insurance and all of our contractors have had to comply with it.
**Bclymer**: If you have to take out a new policy to do the coverage and there's costs associated with it, I think you should just put it in an email to show what that cost is.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I can, I can get a, I can get a workup of what it would cost to, to meet those, those requirements.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
**Bclymer**: It's.
**Bclymer**: It's best to just submit it that way to say, hey, look, based on your insurance requirements and what we have in our policy, we have to take our new policy to meet these terms.
**Bclymer**: Unfortunately, this is additional cost of whatever.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: The pollution and whatever else that isn't standard, I think is what the added policy items would be.
**Jdawson**: And again, I haven't got a chance to go through all these comments since I got it Monday.
**Jdawson**: But just going off of memory here, the, you know, the insurance requirement, like going.
**Jdawson**: Being us being liable and hold, you know, being responsible with our general liability for three years, like, that's not it.
**Jdawson**: I could, I don't know if I take out a new policy per se, to cover that.
**Jdawson**: I, or if I did, I don't know if you'd want to pay it.
**Jdawson**: I mean, you know, our insurance is.
**Jdawson**: You're talking over 100 grand to, to have coverage for a company our size a year.
**Bclymer**: Understood.
**Bclymer**: Was there also a comment on Builders Risk?
**Jdawson**: I mean, we don't, we don't.
**Jdawson**: It's.
**Jdawson**: It wasn't called out.
**Jdawson**: I don't remember us.
**Jdawson**: I don't.
**Jdawson**: Unless it was missed in the request.
**Jdawson**: I don't remember requiring a special Builders Risk policy.
**Bclymer**: Okay, understood.
**Bclymer**: I just came up in another thing, so just wondering.
**Bclymer**: I think this is, this is fine, right?
**Bclymer**: The waivers.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I mean, that's what we, you know, we talked about with your attorney.
**Jdawson**: Like they have a zillion different affidavits and, and all this stuff.
**Jdawson**: And it's like, guys, we, we have, you know, you have a conditional lien waiver on submission.
**Jdawson**: You have unconditionals when it's paid, like that's if you want some special verbiage added, we can do that.
**Jdawson**: But you know, explain, you know, and this way I asked your attorney explain to me why I need four documents that say the same thing.
**Jdawson**: Like, I understand they like paper.
**Jdawson**: We are not the same gut type like or efficiency.
**Bclymer**: Let me see what the others submitted for a waiver and see if I can get you exception.
**Bclymer**: Just the final waiver just shows that all the subcontractor waivers.
**Bclymer**: See if there's other ones.
**Bclymer**: Subcontractor final waivers.
**Bclymer**: It's just an unconditional lien waiver.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, unconditional lien waiver just is.
**Jdawson**: Yes, we've been paid.
**Jdawson**: There's zero conditions.
**Jdawson**: You know, it's.
**Jdawson**: Again, I don't know how familiar you guys are, but it's just you're waiving your lien rights against the building, which is what you want.
**Bclymer**: Right?
**Bclymer**: I'll about the unconditional waiver because it's essentially the same thing.
**Bclymer**: Because I know what what's submitted to us normally and it's just an unconditional waiver.
**Bclymer**: It doesn't have.
**Bclymer**: What is it?
**Bclymer**: Payroll, fill material, equipment, tax.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, all that stuff.
**Jdawson**: Like, you know, this is written a lot of this.
**Jdawson**: And this is another thing when I was reading this, a lot of this is written as a cost plus project where you have a staff accountant dedicated to the project that's pushing all this paper.
**Jdawson**: Like this is the kind of stuff that whenever we build like at a VA hospital, like government stuff.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
**Bclymer**: I'll talk to legal about this point 5.1.3.
**Bclymer**: Because I do have an unconditional lien waiver from all my other other projects, which I guess satisfies 5.1.1.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I mean all that, you know, very.
**Jdawson**: In the.
**Jdawson**: The comment, the original medium was this is very redundant.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, that.
**Bclymer**: That affidavit 5.1.1 kind of.
**Bclymer**: Kind of satisfies 5.1.3.
**Jdawson**: So exactly.
**Jdawson**: It's same thing with a 5 with 5.1.2.
**Jdawson**: Like 5 1.1 solves it all.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah.
**Bclymer**: Understood.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Hey, Yusuke, can you send me this document and then I'll see if I can help legal with some of these points.
**Bclymer**: Okay, let's keep going.
**Bclymer**: Like I said, I can only comment on what I can comment on.
**Bclymer**: Right, right.
**Bclymer**: Acknowledges acceptance essential to owner's plan interest.
**Bclymer**: There are four times a day both contractor owner credits is average sustained by owner and the event to contractor field owner.
**Bclymer**: Oh, this is a liquidated damages cost.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, okay.
**Jdawson**: Which without again and I brought this up Talking to Zuke with, with liquidated damages, when you send out a bid invite you, hey, this job has liquidity damages.
**Jdawson**: And you put it in there to sneak it into a contract like this.
**Jdawson**: It literally offended me at first because I've never seen it.
**Jdawson**: Because that's not how business is done.
**Jdawson**: Because when you do liquidated damages, there's especially something like this that is very aggressive.
**Jdawson**: Like you just apply.
**Jdawson**: You, you, you coordinate it properly.
**Jdawson**: Because it's like, okay, we're going to make sure that we have the proper staff and everything's checked and our subs are exactly have everything down the line.
**Jdawson**: Because what we do right, when we get a liquidated damage, well, we go back to the subs and we put liquidated damages on them.
**Jdawson**: That's how the bidding process works.
**Jdawson**: Because otherwise it would all be on our liability.
**Jdawson**: So that's priced in the bid, which wasn't done.
**Jdawson**: And so to try to sneak it in after this, it's like, wait a minute, guys.
**Jdawson**: Like, we can't guarantee our subs are going to agree to this.
**Jdawson**: They might walk and say, I'm not agreeing to that.
**Bclymer**: Brandon.
**Bclymer**: I don't think it was done in, in malice.
**Bclymer**: It's just a template form that we use in the store construction site.
**Bclymer**: So it probably just wasn't known.
**Bclymer**: Given the type of work this is and the schedule, what are the risks at the end?
**Bclymer**: Like let's say 375 days from.
**Jdawson**: Honestly, you have zero risk.
**Jdawson**: For me, your risk is exotech.
**Jdawson**: Like they're your biggest thing with that.
**Jdawson**: And frankly, I can go ahead and tell you this, there is zero chance that is going to work because I can guarantee you that that schedule that's already put out there, the moment that one item is missed, if you guys don't put them on notice and go after them, the whole thing is void.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Jdawson**: So for us, like, this is a useless thing because it's never gonna, it's never going to work.
**Jdawson**: And in reality, again, exotech is driving the entire schedule.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Because they're the critical path.
**Bclymer**: Not.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, like we, we can't do anything without them.
**Jdawson**: It all, it all exists there.
**Jdawson**: And so the moment that they miss a day, we have to put you on notice and go through this legal jargon.
**Bclymer**: Understood.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: I mean, I understand that the client vendor is the one that is in critical path.
**Bclymer**: So I guess this will be a business decision on our part.
**Bclymer**: And I'll flag it to legal and our CFO that that is the case.
**Jdawson**: And he'll send you this.
**Jdawson**: I Sent back some verbiage because if you read the numbers on this, this is ridiculous.
**Jdawson**: Like the amount of money, it's like no way.
**Jdawson**: Like nobody would ever agree to this.
**Bclymer**: On the retail side, they.
**Bclymer**: On the retail side, then somehow they do.
**Bclymer**: But anyway, that's.
**Jdawson**: Maybe those are smaller jobs, but when you're dealing with jobs this size and you start putting percentages on it, that stuff adds up very fast.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, but again, like, I mean I've.
**Jdawson**: Done $100 million hospitals that don't have as aggressive liquidity damages.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, it's totally fine.
**Bclymer**: It's totally fine that the different business sections that we have just does things a little bit differently.
**Bclymer**: The retail side, every day that we miss opening day, it cost the company a lot of money, which is why the percentages are the way they are.
**Bclymer**: But since this is more of a logistics projects a little bit different.
**Bclymer**: So I'll bring this up to legal and our CFO and see, see what we can do here.
**Bclymer**: It's probably fine.
**Bclymer**: But let me see what they say.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, that makes sense.
**Jdawson**: Whenever you gotta, you gotta see patrons, like you're not gonna have, have that issue with this because once that racking is again, unless, unless exotech misses their ship date, things don't arrive.
**Jdawson**: That's when you're talking about massive delays.
**Jdawson**: But when you're actually talking about the building of it, when the racking, the materials here, like your, your delays.
**Jdawson**: Because once you finish this, you've got four months.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Software and testing like you're gonna have, that's where your, your time's gonna work out.
**Jdawson**: It's only if, if they don't hit their ship date, if Joe doesn't get the material here, that's when you're gonna kick back months at a time.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah.
**Bclymer**: I think, I think it's just that the, this, this maybe this portion is on the wrong side of the like the vendor side.
**Bclymer**: But that's okay.
**Bclymer**: We'll just move on.
**Bclymer**: I actually only have five minutes where I have to go, so we have to get to the next ones quite quickly.
**Bclymer**: The insurance, that'll be our insurance team.
**Bclymer**: They'll do it.
**Bclymer**: They'll check this out.
**Bclymer**: Pollution, liability.
**Bclymer**: There's probably nothing here related to that.
**Bclymer**: But anyway, keep going.
**Bclymer**: Change orders.
**Bclymer**: What is this?
**Jdawson**: This is the, the markup which I believe we already agreed to in this initial meeting.
**Jdawson**: Basically what I'm saying is.
**Jdawson**: No, our markup stays per what our proposal is.
**Bclymer**: What is it?
**Bclymer**: 10 and 1.2 and 1.25.
**Bclymer**: That's fine.
**Bclymer**: You know like every job.
**Bclymer**: This will happen.
**Bclymer**: 10% is already included here.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, you're right.
**Jdawson**: That's what I said.
**Jdawson**: That's when we had our initial call.
**Jdawson**: I said, oh, we're just gonna.
**Jdawson**: We're gonna keep what we have shown.
**Bclymer**: That's fine.
**Bclymer**: You know, like, every construction job will have no change orders.
**Bclymer**: This game.
**Jdawson**: Okay, he's kidding.
**Bclymer**: Let's just move on.
**Bclymer**: There's always way to reduce change order costs by reducing scope or simplifying details.
**Bclymer**: So it should be fine.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we're not.
**Jdawson**: Again, we.
**Jdawson**: We went through pretty, you know, with the med and stuff to be your stuff ahead of time.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Make sure it was the right design.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: Greatly appreciate it.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: I think.
**Bclymer**: I think we're good.
**Bclymer**: Can you go back to Alana's email?
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: What was the comment number?
**Bclymer**: Nine.
**Bclymer**: Number nine.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Our change order.
**Bclymer**: We can agree to automatic extension of completion dates.
**Bclymer**: I guess it would have to be.
**Bclymer**: It's not automatic.
**Bclymer**: It would be agreed to because we'll be signing the change order that extends the schedule.
**Bclymer**: Right?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Change order shall automatically extend the substantial completed date without penalty.
**Bclymer**: Maybe they just didn't like the word automatic.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, that's.
**Jdawson**: I mean, that's again, a minor detail in my opinion.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Understood.
**Bclymer**: So I think maybe we should write ownership review and respond proposed change orders within 10 business days.
**Bclymer**: Owners delay in a proven change or shall automatically extend.
**Bclymer**: I mean, maybe it's just owner's delay in approving change order shall affect the schedule.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I mean, that's the biggest thing is.
**Jdawson**: Is the point of that, is that, you know, if, you know, let's say that you want to add a second story to this building.
**Jdawson**: I'm like, all right, here you go.
**Jdawson**: It's $7 million.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: And you take three months to say yes.
**Jdawson**: Like, I'm not on the hook for the same.
**Jdawson**: Because it reverts back to talking about the liquidated damages.
**Jdawson**: Now all of a sudden, you know, I just delayed because of your lack of action, but held to the same finish date.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, they.
**Bclymer**: They just don't like the word automatic.
**Bclymer**: I think just writing, owners delay in approving change order shall affect the substantial completion date.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, it's essentially saying the same thing.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Two point.
**Bclymer**: I don't.
**Bclymer**: I forgot what 2.2 was.
**Bclymer**: But anyway, the rest of it, I think it's fine.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: I'll take this, I'll comment on it, and then we'll send it back to legal.
**Bclymer**: We'll have a conversation with Alex and move on.
**Jdawson**: Certainly.
**Bclymer**: Okay.

**Bclymer**: They're just trying to protect the company, so you have to see it from their.
**Bclymer**: Their perspective.
**Bclymer**: I know.
**Bclymer**: I know the protection is quite aggressive, but it's just we've been burned so many times before in our.
**Bclymer**: In our years of business, so we just want to make sure that, you know, things are looking okay.
**Bclymer**: But we understand that it's.
**Bclymer**: It's difficult to agree to, but.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I mean, at the end of the day, like, I have to think about, like, you know, these people depend on me and, you know, the company and some of this language, it could put me out of business, and I'm not willing to take that risk.
