## Transcript
**Ahuettl**: I think that we can go ahead and get going.
**Ahuettl**: Karli, anybody from.
**Ahuettl**: Is Evan gonna be joining or.
**James.manhart**: No, he's in Chicago today and Connie's out at a funeral, so just me.
**James.manhart**: Okay.
**Ahuettl**: Well, I have a couple things on my list to get through and I apologize.
**Ahuettl**: I'm on site today, so running around my computer's not in front of me, but schedule wise, just wanted to give you guys an update.
**Ahuettl**: We, as we know, we were kind of pushing on this.
**Ahuettl**: So we ran into a little snag with the lintels above the windows Carmel is wanting us to add.
**Ahuettl**: So there's some lead time issues there as far as the masonry goes.
**Ahuettl**: And then there was a little bit of time, more time we took on our underground, finding our tie in location.
**Ahuettl**: So that put us back a couple days.
**Ahuettl**: So Alex and I are going to work on here today, actualizing the schedule.
**James.manhart**: Okay.
**Ahuettl**: And we'll send that out to you guys.
**Ahuettl**: You know, all along our goal is to get that demising wall built in time.
**Ahuettl**: We're starting the drywall now, but that way you guys can at least get in there and start doing your thing while we're finishing up.
**James.manhart**: Okay.
**Ahuettl**: That being said, we'll actualize the schedule.
**Ahuettl**: And I noticed we've been sending out weekly reports.
**Ahuettl**: However, the FedEx team and Niessink, you guys haven't been on last two weeks, so since we started.
**Ahuettl**: So I will make sure.
**Ahuettl**: I was out last Friday, but I'll make sure we include you guys on those and I'll.
**Ahuettl**: And we'll send the last two reports to you.
**Ahuettl**: That way you have those.
**Ahuettl**: It's a good way to keep up with what's going on, any delays, et cetera.
**Ahuettl**: Plus it's got photos of the space.
**Ahuettl**: Okay, sounds good.
**Ahuettl**: Sounds good.
**Ahuettl**: Okay.
**Ahuettl**: As far as permitting goes, Molly, I assume you guys submitted, is that correct?
**Sclevenger**: We did, and I think now we're probably.
**Sclevenger**: Yeah, I think.
**Sclevenger**: I think it went in finally last Friday.
**James.manhart**: Okay.
**Ahuettl**: I noticed it because the Niemann team sent me an email.
**Ahuettl**: Did you guys know you're fine?
**Ahuettl**: Did you guys apply for a state release?
**Sclevenger**: I don't know.
**Sclevenger**: I can check.
**Sclevenger**: We have a permit handler that submits for us, so if there's something we missed or something we shouldn't do, let me know.
**Ahuettl**: No, no, no.
**Ahuettl**: I, I just.
**Ahuettl**: In.
**Ahuettl**: In Indiana, if you're building under a hundred foot of wall, I believe is the rule, you.
**Ahuettl**: You technically don't have to apply for its date release.
**Ahuettl**: And I think you guys did, which it's not going to hurt anything.
**James.manhart**: Okay.
**Ahuettl**: Notice because.
**Ahuettl**: Because niemann asked if that was ours because it was asking for fees to get paid.
**Ahuettl**: And I was like, ah, I'm gonna assume that's FedEx's release because we have release, so.
**James.manhart**: Okay.
**Ahuettl**: I mean, the state's gonna gladly take your money, so they don't care.
**Ahuettl**: But that's.
**Ahuettl**: I was just curious.
**Ahuettl**: So I figured you guys did submit.
**James.manhart**: Okay.
**Ahuettl**: I did submit for your signed permit as well.
**Sclevenger**: Right.
**Ahuettl**: And I included Kelly Danner on that.
**James.manhart**: Okay.
**Ahuettl**: So should just be a box check.
**Ahuettl**: We already got approved on it through the ADLS amendment.
**Sclevenger**: Okay.
**Ahuettl**: And so I was waiting for some clarity.
**Ahuettl**: alleatogroup is the girl at Carmel that.
**Ahuettl**: That deals with that.
**James.manhart**: Hey, Sean.
**Sclevenger**: Good morning.
**Ahuettl**: Good morning.
**James.manhart**: Hey.
**Ahuettl**: I was just going through some things with FedEx.
**Ahuettl**: You know, I told him we have a little schedule delay with our.
**Ahuettl**: With our masonry for that front entrance and with our underground plumbing.
**Ahuettl**: We're hoping to pour back that plumbing here soon.
**Ahuettl**: That being said, there is a big kind of question mark I had as I was studying these plans and our guys on site.
**Ahuettl**: I know where we Left it at FedEx team, you guys are expecting junction boxes for your electricians, is that correct?
**Sclevenger**: I believe so.
**Sclevenger**: I believe that's correct.
**Connie**: Yes, I believe that is.
**Ahuettl**: Okay.
**Ahuettl**: So I.
**Ahuettl**: So we.
**Ahuettl**: We provided convenience outlets per code, which we have to do.
**Ahuettl**: Other than that, I think I'm going to mark up a drawing and I just need to get approval because we need to see, like, where we leave it at for you guys.
**Ahuettl**: I just want to make sure everybody's on the same page.
**Sclevenger**: Okay.
**Ahuettl**: As far as electrical go.
**Ahuettl**: So I'm going to mark up a drawing and make sure we get something in the spots you need for you guys to tie into for all of your fixtures, etc.
**Ahuettl**: Okay.
**Sclevenger**: Okay.
**Ahuettl**: There's actually on the exterior wall.
**Ahuettl**: I know there's quite a bit of electrical.
**Ahuettl**: And so I just want to make sure we're all on the same page with that.
**Ahuettl**: I'll mark that up and get that out to you.
**Ahuettl**: Expect that no later than midday tomorrow.
**Ahuettl**: I already started.
**Ahuettl**: So when I get on site today, I'll be able to have a better idea of what actually we completed as far as the convenience outlets go.
**Ahuettl**: Any questions for me, guys?
**Sclevenger**: I don't have any.
**Connie**: The.
**Connie**: The exterior masonries.
**Connie**: I mean, that.
**Connie**: That wouldn't affect really our ability to work on the inside.
**Connie**: You said you're hoping to get the.
**Connie**: The backfill on the plumbing done sometime this week?
**Ahuettl**: Yeah, that's what.
**Ahuettl**: That's what we're hoping for.
**Ahuettl**: It took us a little longer to Locate.
**Ahuettl**: So Carmel has given us the okay to proceed.
**Ahuettl**: So we're getting our concrete guy scheduled, and we've already started putting our drywall up on the demising wall.
**Ahuettl**: And it, you know, it helps that that other side is unfinished until we find a tenant.
**Ahuettl**: And so we'll get this one side rocked for you guys and finished.
**Ahuettl**: And then that way, as soon as possible, we can get in there and start putting that ceiling grid That's.
**Ahuettl**: That's kind of critical path.
**Ahuettl**: Right now we're working on all of our overhead.
**Ahuettl**: H vac is done.
**Ahuettl**: Lighting is starting to hang their wire for all the two by four supports.
**Ahuettl**: And then once we get that drywall done, we'll just continue on with our.
**Ahuettl**: Our wall mold and ceiling grid and try to get it knocked out as soon as possible.
**Connie**: Yeah, because you got a.
**Connie**: What's the deck there?
**Connie**: 18?
**Ahuettl**: No, it's like 25 foot, and you're.
**Connie**: Coming down to 12 or 10.
**Ahuettl**: We're coming.
**Ahuettl**: We're coming down to.
**Ahuettl**: I don't have the drawings in front of me.
**Ahuettl**: I think it's nine or ten, James.
**Connie**: Yeah, I don't either.
**Connie**: Usually it's.
**Connie**: It should be around 10, but.
**Connie**: Yeah, yeah, that's a.
**Connie**: That's a task in its own right.
**Ahuettl**: Yeah, yeah.
**Ahuettl**: So we.
**Ahuettl**: So we have to get all that above.
**Ahuettl**: Above ceiling done and get all that sprinkler pipe, since we're tying into the existing system lowered, it's almost essentially creating a whole new system about 12 foot below the existing system that's on the deck right now.
**Ahuettl**: It's taking a little time, and with not being able to backfill this long trench we have going down the center, it's hard to get lifts around a little bit.
**Ahuettl**: But like I said, Alex and I will actualize the schedule and give you guys a better idea of when you can get in there.
**Ahuettl**: But we're.
**Ahuettl**: We're continuing on with what we can do to try and not lose any time.
**Connie**: Understood.
**Ahuettl**: Like I said, we'll start.
**Ahuettl**: Yeah, yeah, we'll start sharing those weekly reports, and that kind of shed some light, and it's cool to see pictures as it progresses.
**James.manhart**: AJ did you guys officially get permits?
**James.manhart**: I know the last call you said that you did okay.
**Ahuettl**: We did.
**Ahuettl**: Yeah.
**Ahuettl**: Yeah.
**Ahuettl**: I think we got them Friday of.
**Ahuettl**: Not last week, but the week before.
**Ahuettl**: So we got a whole week's worth of work in before we actually had it, which was.
**Ahuettl**: Which was good to keep.
**Ahuettl**: Keep pushing.
**Ahuettl**: Awesome.
**Connie**: And, Jay, what was your real time frame on getting your permits?
**Connie**: I know it was.
**Connie**: I know they so kept going back and forth.
**Ahuettl**: The building permit was quick.
**Ahuettl**: I mean, I. I can pull the.
**Ahuettl**: It's nice because Carmel kind of sends you, like, an aging report.
**Ahuettl**: The building permit was fairly quick if you factor in how long it took us to get the.
**Ahuettl**: The facade amendment.
**Ahuettl**: The facade amendment took us Roughly, I think, 50 to 60 days, which is just.
**Ahuettl**: I've never seen it take that long.
**Ahuettl**: So once we got that facade amendment, we were able to then just submit that and answer comments on the building permit.
**Ahuettl**: And then I would say it took us three to four weeks in total for the building permit.
**Ahuettl**: Okay.
**Ahuettl**: I would hope.
**Ahuettl**: And it's.
**Ahuettl**: It's hard to hope with how this has gone, that being that we already have a permit for.
**Ahuettl**: For the main feeds, for the power, and for creating the tenant spaces, you guys should get yours fairly quickly.
**Ahuettl**: James.
**Connie**: Yeah.
**Ahuettl**: And feel.
**Ahuettl**: And feel free to let.
**Ahuettl**: Let us know if.
**Ahuettl**: If you're not getting responses from the city.
**Ahuettl**: We're right around the corner, so I can stop by and ask them what's going on for you.
**Ahuettl**: Neil, any questions?
**Ahuettl**: Not from my end.
**Ahuettl**: Okay, guys.
**Ahuettl**: Well, we have a couple action items on our end.
**Ahuettl**: Expect the updated schedule.
**Ahuettl**: We'll send out those weekly reports to you, and we'll just keep on plugging away.
**Connie**: Okay, thank you.
**Ahuettl**: All right.
**James.manhart**: Thanks, AJ.
**Sclevenger**: Thank you.
