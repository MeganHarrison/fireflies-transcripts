## Transcript
**Ahuettl**: Sa.
**James.manhart**: Okay, so I don't think we're waiting on anyone else, so I'll go ahead and get going here.
**James.manhart**: Unless FedEx.
**James.manhart**: Are you expecting anyone else from your team?
**Sclevenger**: I don't think so.
**Sclevenger**: James is on.
**Sclevenger**: I think Neil is out of the office right.
**Ahuettl**: Right now.
**Connie**: Steve would jump on if he had time, but he may not.
**Ahuettl**: Yeah.
**Ahuettl**: Okay.
**James.manhart**: Well, hey, I.
**James.manhart**: This is going to be a quick one.
**James.manhart**: I got some pretty good news.
**James.manhart**: Caramel sent in their last comments.
**James.manhart**: They had two comments signage related, and they actually had missed what I had already submitted.
**James.manhart**: So I. I corrected them to the right page, sent those in yesterday.
**Ahuettl**: And.
**James.manhart**: They said they had no further comments.
**James.manhart**: So they're going to push this to the building department once the paperwork processes, hopefully today.
**James.manhart**: And I'll send that confirmation out to everyone on that thread.
**James.manhart**: But I now expect to get a permit by the end of the week.
**James.manhart**: And I'm comfortable with cutting the openings in the side of the building.
**James.manhart**: Now we.
**James.manhart**: We did.
**James.manhart**: The last two weeks, we've been trying to get as much done as possible.
**James.manhart**: Now it's kind of hard to get material in there without having a door directly into the space, but we were able to get some steel in there.
**James.manhart**: So we got ahead on.
**James.manhart**: We got ahead on our steel reinforcement actually yesterday.
**James.manhart**: And then we were able to get a little ahead on running that new electrical service over there from their distribution panel in the north east corner of the building.
**James.manhart**: So made up a little time there.
**James.manhart**: That being said, I'm gonna put together an updated schedule according to our timeline now.
**James.manhart**: And I'm gonna do my best.
**James.manhart**: If you guys just give me a day or two to tweak some things, see how we can stack subcontractors so we can make this not bleed into September too much.
**James.manhart**: So give me a little bit to kind of call my subs.
**James.manhart**: All material has been ordered.
**James.manhart**: We have the RTU waiting in a warehouse.
**James.manhart**: So as far as that goes, I'm confident that we can just start knocking it out now.
**James.manhart**: We're gonna.
**James.manhart**: We're gonna have bodies stacked on top of each other, and so that'll take some good coordination.
**James.manhart**: You know, Alex has been in contact with all of our subs.
**James.manhart**: Rock and roll.
**James.manhart**: Um, but yeah, just give me.
**James.manhart**: Give me a couple days to get with those guys and.
**James.manhart**: And really lock in a schedule here to try and tighten it up.
**Connie**: Okay, quick question for you, aj.
**Connie**: So what you're looking at now is what, like maybe second.
**Connie**: Second week in September turnover?
**James.manhart**: I think.
**James.manhart**: I think that's what I'm looking at.
**James.manhart**: I don't want to make.
**James.manhart**: I don't want to.
**Connie**: Not gonna hold you to it.
**Connie**: I just want to make a note that way I have it in my.
**Connie**: In my notes.
**James.manhart**: Yeah.
**Connie**: To start doing other stuff.
**James.manhart**: Yeah.
**James.manhart**: And, James, I'm gonna.
**James.manhart**: I'm gonna bust butt to try and move that up, but I don't want to.
**James.manhart**: I don't want to commit to first week of September still, and then you guys be mad at me.
**James.manhart**: So I want to be able to work towards that second week of September.
**James.manhart**: And honestly, you know, once I get this permit issued, you guys go ahead and file for your permit.
**James.manhart**: And, you know, they should let us have two permits open at once.
**James.manhart**: And, you know, if there's a way potentially.
**James.manhart**: I'm not sure you guys have done these in the past before we're officially undone.
**James.manhart**: Maybe we can figure out how to make that happen.
**James.manhart**: So I gotta.
**James.manhart**: I gotta look at the drawings and double check our schedule, but that's kind of where my thought is.
**James.manhart**: That second, second week of September.
**Ahuettl**: Okay.
**Ahuettl**: Yeah.
**Connie**: It just.
**Connie**: It allows me to.
**Connie**: To set a schedule for getting my GCs together and doing all of that.
**James.manhart**: I appreciate everybody's patience.
**James.manhart**: You know, I sent that.
**James.manhart**: That aging report in my email.
**James.manhart**: I think it was July 4th weekend week or something like that, just to show you.
**James.manhart**: I.
**James.manhart**: We had every intention of starting way sooner and being very far along at this point, but it was sitting in Carmel's court for some time, which is unfortunate, but we'll power through and see if we can't speed things along.
**Sclevenger**: And, aj, your permit that you're receiving is going to include our signage permit.
**Sclevenger**: So I can go ahead and give our sign vendor the okay to start fabricating, right?
**James.manhart**: Yeah.
**James.manhart**: Can you.
**James.manhart**: Until I get an official.
**Ahuettl**: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
**James.manhart**: Like, give me a couple of days.
**James.manhart**: Molly.
**Ahuettl**: Yeah.
**James.manhart**: Just because I.
**James.manhart**: But I will send a confirmation.
**James.manhart**: But yes, I submitted that signage package, and her name's Elisa.
**James.manhart**: She does.
**James.manhart**: Or Eliza.
**James.manhart**: She does all the signage in Carmel.
**James.manhart**: And.
**Ahuettl**: Okay.
**James.manhart**: She.
**James.manhart**: She said no further comments now until I get that in the portal, I'm not going to release you.
**Ahuettl**: Okay.
**James.manhart**: Other than that.
**James.manhart**: Any questions for me?
**Sclevenger**: Not on my end.
**Connie**: No, I'm good.
**Ahuettl**: Okay.
**James.manhart**: Like I said, appreciate everybody's patience, and I'm excited here at our next meeting to show some construction progress.
**Sclevenger**: Sounds good.
**James.manhart**: All righty, guys.
**James.manhart**: Have a good one.
**Ahuettl**: Appreciate it, A.J.
**James.manhart**: See you.
**Ahuettl**: Bye.
