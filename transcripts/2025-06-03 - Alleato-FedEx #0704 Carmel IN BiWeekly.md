## Transcript
**Ahuettl**: Okay, I'm gonna get going here.
**Ahuettl**: I'm gonna share my screen.
**Ahuettl**: Been a while since we last met.
**Ahuettl**: A lot has happened.
**Ahuettl**: And we're gearing up to start here in the next couple of weeks.
**Ahuettl**: There's, there's two things I wanted to accomplish today.
**Ahuettl**: The first thing is verifying schedule.
**Ahuettl**: And there's some coordination involved with my electricians and, and FedEx, obviously.
**Ahuettl**: And then just giving you an update on this ADLS amendment.
**Ahuettl**: So I'll start with the ADLS amendment.
**Ahuettl**: So we, we submitted our plans to Carmel.
**Ahuettl**: They came back, they didn't like our entrance.
**Ahuettl**: They wanted it to pop a little more, they said.
**Ahuettl**: And they didn't think the Audi accomplished that, unfortunately.
**Ahuettl**: So what they replied is they, they kind of drew up something similar to what the other entrance is there.
**Ahuettl**: Let me pull these photos up.
**Ahuettl**: So this is the harvest Market entrance.
**Ahuettl**: That's on the same side as where FedEx will be.
**Ahuettl**: And so she drew this up, sent this to me.
**Ahuettl**: We added some more glass, did these masonry column build build outs.
**Ahuettl**: And this is what we came up with that the city is going to approve.
**Ahuettl**: So right now is this FedEx's first time seeing this?
**Ahuettl**: I sent it last week.
**James.manhart**: Okay.
**Sclevenger**: Yeah, we've seen it.
**Connie**: I think they okayed it.
**James.manhart**: Okay.
**Ahuettl**: Yeah.
**Ahuettl**: Unfortunately, we're at the mercy of the city when it comes to this.
**Ahuettl**: There, it's caramel.
**Ahuettl**: They're going to do, they're going to do what they want.
**Ahuettl**: And if they want a nicer building, we got to give them a nicer building.
**Ahuettl**: So.
**Ahuettl**: So is there any questions regarding this on, on FedEx side?
**Neil.cardenas**: No, I think it looks great.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Ahuettl**: Yeah, I think it looks really sharp.
**Ahuettl**: So we'll only be doing the one entrance at first.
**Ahuettl**: And so if you, if you kind of blank out this area, that's, that's what it'll look like.
**Ahuettl**: And then the only other thing I'm working through is, is getting your guys signed permit right now.
**Ahuettl**: I haven't received comments back.
**Ahuettl**: I don't expect to have any changes to it.
**Sclevenger**: Is that for the side of the building?
**Ahuettl**: It's pretty comprehensive, that packet you guys provide.
**Ahuettl**: So if there are questions, I'll make sure I coordinate that.
**Neil.cardenas**: I was having my sign vendor revise their package based on this elevation.
**Neil.cardenas**: Do you want to wait and resubmit it or can you get a permit based on the old package?
**Ahuettl**: I can get a permit based on the old package.
**Ahuettl**: So they, they review together.
**Ahuettl**: So they'll look at this and have a general idea of what your signage will look like.
**Ahuettl**: I Think.
**Ahuettl**: And, and so I'd like to wait for their comments.
**Ahuettl**: I mean, no news is sometimes good news and I'm hoping to hear back this week on all that.
**Ahuettl**: But right now we need to get everybody's approval on this ADLS amendment and then signage should shortly follow and then building permission follow after that.
**Ahuettl**: So.
**Neil.cardenas**: So I should not need to have my signed vendor submit for a permit.
**Neil.cardenas**: You're going to do that for us?
**Ahuettl**: I'm doing it for you guys.
**Ahuettl**: Yep.
**Neil.cardenas**: Perfect.
**Neil.cardenas**: Okay, I'll let them know.
**Ahuettl**: Yeah, it's a part.
**Ahuettl**: Anytime you change the exterior in Carmel signage adding an entrance, they.
**Ahuettl**: They kind of review those congruently.
**Ahuettl**: Any other questions regarding the, the facade?
**Sclevenger**: Yeah, on the side of the building.
**Sclevenger**: How many inches is that sign?
**Ahuettl**: How many.
**Ahuettl**: I'm sorry, Neil, you're a little.
**Sclevenger**: How many inches?
**Ahuettl**: How many inches tall?
**Sclevenger**: Yeah.
**Ahuettl**: I can tell you here a second.
**Ahuettl**: So this one is showing, this one's showing three foot on this rendering what I submitted.
**Ahuettl**: I'm not sure in that packet what size you guys had, but they'll be going off of what you see on that packet.
**Ahuettl**: I can tell you right now they will not approve a sign probably that big on the side of the building.
**Ahuettl**: There's a, there's a, there's a road that runs right by here.
**Ahuettl**: Let me see if I can pull up the.
**Ahuettl**: So this road runs right by there.
**Ahuettl**: There's a lot of traffic.
**Ahuettl**: I don't think they'll allow a sign that big.
**Ahuettl**: So if I pull up, see here.
**Ahuettl**: Well, maybe it is a three foot sign.
**Neil.cardenas**: Well, we'll see if they submit.
**Neil.cardenas**: If they approve it.
**Neil.cardenas**: They may not approve it.
**Ahuettl**: We'll see if they approve it.
**Ahuettl**: I didn't, I didn't look at this and see that it was three foot tall.
**Ahuettl**: But we'll see what they say.
**Ahuettl**: They may make you shrink it.
**Ahuettl**: I.
**Ahuettl**: I don't know yet, to be honest.
**James.manhart**: Okay.
**Ahuettl**: Any other questions?
**Sclevenger**: Oh, I do have another question.
**Sclevenger**: We're still on track for a September 1st turnover?
**Ahuettl**: Yep, still gearing up for a September 1st turnover.
**Ahuettl**: And, and now that you asked that, I did want to dive into to this schedule so there's some coordination that has to happen.
**Ahuettl**: So this is going to change a little bit based off of our new entrance feature.
**Ahuettl**: As far as what's happening, timeline won't change, but the.
**Ahuettl**: These line items will for tasks.
**Ahuettl**: So I have turnover as 9:1.
**Ahuettl**: However, I have to have my electrician run the electrical for you guys and then you need to come in and you'll install your own furniture casework etc.
**Ahuettl**: And then my electricians will have to come back, is my understanding, and finish and terminate everything.
**Ahuettl**: Is that correct?
**Neil.cardenas**: I.
**Neil.cardenas**: I think what our general plan is, and James, correct me if I'm wrong, is to have you guys run the junction boxes and then we will have our people come in and terminate it, run it to the equipment.
**Ahuettl**: Okay.
**James.manhart**: I believe that's correct.
**Ahuettl**: Okay.
**Ahuettl**: I just want to make sure you aren't going to need us to come and help with anything after that.
**Ahuettl**: Because once I get Carmel in there for a final inspection, I just want to make sure we coordinate what that ending looks like.
**Ahuettl**: And so my, my plan is to have your finishes basically under our permit.
**Ahuettl**: So we won't close the, close this permit out until you guys are totally done with your scope.
**Neil.cardenas**: Now we'll need to submit for permit also, I think unless we can get by with just a trade permit for a electrical, which might be the case.
**James.manhart**: That.
**Ahuettl**: Yeah, I'll help coordinate that, Molly.
**Ahuettl**: But, but I already, I already sent them FedEx's electrical drawing to help speed that process up for you guys.
**Neil.cardenas**: Okay.
**James.manhart**: Now quick question.
**James.manhart**: Does that also have low voltage on it?
**Ahuettl**: Yep.
**James.manhart**: Okay.
**Ahuettl**: So I will, I will change some of the tasks in here to reflect that.
**Ahuettl**: And then I send two week look aheads once construction starts.
**Ahuettl**: So you guys have an idea of where we're tracking.
**Ahuettl**: I update this schedule weekly and then we'll, we'll review it every, every other week in our meetings.
**Ahuettl**: And I also send a weekly report out and it's got photos what we did the previous week, what we plan on doing the next week.
**Ahuettl**: And you'll be able to stay up to date on that as well.
**Ahuettl**: And then Alex, I have Alex in here.
**Ahuettl**: He's going to be our superintendent on the project.
**Ahuettl**: So he'll be handling all things on site.
**Ahuettl**: And from there we'll, we'll.
**Ahuettl**: Once we get rolling, we'll be knocking this out pretty quick.
**Ahuettl**: So the plan is on the 16th, assuming I get this amendment approved here shortly, we'll start cutting holes into the side of the building and it'll start looking different pretty quickly.
**James.manhart**: Awesome.
**James.manhart**: So you're hoping to get started on doing the new storefront on the 16th?
**Ahuettl**: Yeah, so we'll, we'll cut.
**Ahuettl**: It'll take us about four days to get all of our openings cut.
**Ahuettl**: And then we'll have reinforcement involved with that.
**Ahuettl**: We have to structurally reinforce each opening in the precast.
**Ahuettl**: And then we'll put temporary plywood in each opening.
**Ahuettl**: James, because we don't want to get that nice storefront damaged.
**James.manhart**: Right.
**Ahuettl**: And then storefront will probably come in later.
**Ahuettl**: I would say August.
**James.manhart**: Okay.
**Ahuettl**: Any other questions regarding schedule?
**James.manhart**: Can you send me the schedule?
**Ahuettl**: Yeah, let me.
**Ahuettl**: Let me update it reflecting the ADLS amendment and the other task, James, and then I'll shoot it over to you.
**Ahuettl**: All right.
**James.manhart**: I appreciate it.
**Ahuettl**: Neil and Molly.
**Ahuettl**: Anything for me?
**James.manhart**: I don't think so.
**Sclevenger**: Nope.
**Ahuettl**: Nissing team.
**Ahuettl**: You guys good?
**Evan**: Think so.
**Connie**: Good.
**Connie**: Thanks for doing this, AJ These calls are great.
**Connie**: And of course, you're leading it and all.
**Connie**: Good.
**Ahuettl**: Awesome.
**Ahuettl**: Well, that was short and sweet.
**Ahuettl**: So I'll.
**Ahuettl**: I'll send this updated schedule out to everyone, and I'll keep everybody updated on that amendment.
**Ahuettl**: Perfect.
**Sclevenger**: Thank you.
**Ahuettl**: All right.
**Ahuettl**: Thanks, guys.
**Neil.cardenas**: Thank you.
**Evan**: Thanks, A.J.
