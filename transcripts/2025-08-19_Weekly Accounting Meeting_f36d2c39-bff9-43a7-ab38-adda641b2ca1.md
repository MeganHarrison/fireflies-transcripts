**Bclymer:** Yes.

**Jdawson:** Do we have all the July credit cards approved?

**Bclymer:** Oh, sorry, Yes, I was taking on that. Yeah. But we still have around six transactions from July to be approved. Because Jesse was asking a little more clarification on this, but yes, almost. July is complete. Only around six. 20 seconds.

**Jdawson:** Only around six. Okay. And the statement date for the capital one is the 22nd. Right. Something on there. Okay, so we don't have a statement for all this yet?

**Bclymer:** Okay. Yeah, I will send the detail. Around five, ten seconds? Yes.

**Fnjie:** Okay. All right.

**Jmendez:** Does anybody have any burning questions or anything from me?

**Bclymer:** I think in this case, no, but because most of them was, Jesse was asking clarifying on what this is for, for example.

**Fnjie:** That's fine.

**Jmendez:** Okay, so Patina, once these transactions get done, can I get the financials July end of the week?

**Jdawson:** Yes, we will start working on it. But we still need the payroll. We still have not completed payroll allocation. Jose, what are you waiting for for that for the July payroll?

**Jdawson:** Floor will be wet. She's really good.

**Accounting:** Go ahead, Jose.

**Jdawson:** Go ahead.

**Bclymer:** Okay, and I was saying that we have some timesheet for to be updated for Jesse. For Jesse, it's only one timesheet, but we need Alex and Jesse Remillard update. I will send a message to them. Copy to you.

**Jdawson:** Okay, if we need to send an email to Alex, let's do that too so we can get that.

**Bclymer:** Okay.

**Jmendez:** Alex is no longer with the company, so have AJ Fill out his time sheet and then let's get all those filled out. And then, Fatima, if I can get July financials by the end of the week, please.

**Jdawson:** Can you. You shared that email with me, right? About the insurance?

**Aortiz:** Yes.

**Jdawson:** Okay, I'll. I'll. I'll send a message to Brandon and Lisa about that because I haven't seen an invoice and they are talking about a payment plan. So I'll send out an email about that.

**Accounting:** Okay, that's good. And then I know I saw the email you sent to Lisa for the CEO. I. Hopefully she can send it today. Alec needs it, so if not, I'll just try to talk to her in the afternoon. Okay.

**Jdawson:** Okay. Okay. All right. And I can. Let me know if you want me to give her a call.

**Accounting:** Yeah, maybe that'll be awesome. Because Alec needs it kind of like urgent, so if she can just. It's just a matter of sending a document, you know, so.

**Jdawson:** Okay. All right.

**Accounting:** Thank you, Fatima. Okay. Accounts payable and receivable. Review of pending payments, vendor issues, concerns, client billing, updates. It said everything updated. Guys.

**Aortiz:** Fatima, regarding that one that I talked to you earlier. This is regarding the CL Fire or Christopher. Christopher Lopez under GPC High robotic. Actually, this is already processed. Then I. They send an email that there was a commitment created in the job planner, but for checking, it was not synced yet from job planner to Akumatica. It was not pushed. My question is, are we going to push this commitment and then correct the invoice that we have created directly in Akumatica?

**Jdawson:** Yes, I think yes, we have to push the commitment in acumatica and. And then we do basically like a zero invoice. Or you do. You will do a credit just like you did with the invoice to back that out. And then you do an invoice to the commitment. So those two will net to zero. But now we will see the cost on the commitment. Okay. Yeah, so you do. So you do a credit to basically back out the same way you processed it and then you reprocess it on the commitment. So those two will net to zero. We don't need to. We don't need to resend another payment, but at least now we'll have the cost shown on the commitment.

**Aortiz:** Okay, I'll let them know. I'll ask them to push this commitment to Aquamatica. Thank you.

**Jdawson:** When they do, make sure that you do the invoice and the credit at the same time so nothing gets missed.

**Aortiz:** Yeah.

**Jdawson:** Okay.

**Accounting:** Okay, perfect. That's Good. Payroll and compliance updates, Jose.

**Bclymer:** Yeah. And payroll for July should be completed. Completed this week? Yeah, I'm working on that. But yes, I will let you know if I have any times it dependent to be updated. But this week it will be completed for July expenses.

**Jdawson:** Okay. Jose, is it. Is it possible to get that. What's, what's today? Is it Tuesday or Wednesday? I feel like I'm all disoriented.

**Accounting:** You are all.

**Jdawson:** Fatima, today's Tuesday. I am. I. I really am.

**Bclymer:** Yeah.

**Jdawson:** I don't even know what day of the week it is. But if we can get that. If. Please send out the email to AJ and Jesse on what we need. If we can get that done by the end of the day today, I think that'll be great. That will give me and Jesse time to reveal the July whip because Brandon wants the financials by the end of the week. So we are really shut on time with. With the payroll here.

**Bclymer:** Okay, that's good. Yeah.

**Jdawson:** Okay. Please. Thank you. Okay. Okay.

**Fnjie:** As Jesse. Does he have his time card? He needs to send it to fill in. I just did mine.

**Jdawson:** Because I'll tell.

**Fnjie:** Them to do it. What.

**Jdawson:** What week are we talking about, Jose?

**Bclymer:** Oh, let me see. Oh, well we have from JSC from Jesse. We have one pending, but it's for August. The timesheet. Yes. So I think July is complete. Let me see. Yes. Yes. July timesheet is complete for GSC doesn't.

**Jdawson:** Yes.

**Bclymer:** Okay. So that means we only have pending Alex and Jesse Ramillard.

**Fnjie:** So Alex, you can just split it 50. 50 between Applied Engineering and Niemann. The Neiman FedEx one.

**Bclymer:** Okay.

**Fnjie:** And then Candon, you can just do them all. The Uniqlo.

**Bclymer:** Excellent. Okay.

**Jdawson:** Do you need anything else or is that it?

**Bclymer:** I think that's it.

**Jdawson:** That's it. Okay. Are you still going to send a report to Jesse to review?

**Bclymer:** Yeah, I will send when I.

**Jdawson:** Okay. All right, go ahead, Maria.

**Accounting:** Yeah. And from payroll.

**Jdawson:** So I have just to go ahead.

**Accounting:** And make sure that we have everything set up for this Friday. Other than that. That's good. So I might need the timesheets free to see. We did payroll last week or this week?

**Aortiz:** Last week.

**Fnjie:** Last week.

**Accounting:** Okay. So I'm also old Fatima. So we're in this team today.

**Jdawson:** That's good.

**Accounting:** Okay. Perfect. So akumatica. So pending transaction issues and delays. Something there.

**Jdawson:** Oh, Jesse, the item we were looking at this morning with the change orders and stuff, it's okay for us to go ahead and post that 12,000, the last pay app. Right. It's still on hold in Akumatica. We haven't posted it. The one for Goodwill Bloomington, I believe.

**Fnjie:** Oh, for the. Well, he's going to have to do another path for August.

**Jdawson:** Okay, so.

**Fnjie:** Because did he. Did he bill for that change order? Because I thought that was his whole purpose in doing two billings last month was to try to go for that change order he built.

**Jdawson:** The second one for last month was a different one. That was the 36,000, I believe. There's another one for 12,000. The 12,000 I think is the change order. That's the one he pushed through Acumatica. I mean, Dropliner. But we haven't posted it in Acumatica yet. I. I think we need to. Yeah, we just didn't post the variances.

**Fnjie:** Oh, okay. Were you sending that to the Job Planner?

**Jdawson:** Yes.

**Fnjie:** To figure out what the problem is?

**Jdawson:** Yes.

**Fnjie:** I mean, I don't know if that screws up anything. If everything's right in Acumatica, then Job Planner just needs to fix itself. It should be fine.

**Jdawson:** Okay. All right, I think I'll show it. I'll show it to Fritzi after this call and see if she has any idea what's happening. I know she deals with Acumatica in the sync Job Planner and the sync issues more than I do. And then we can send an email.

**Fnjie:** Okay.

**Accounting:** Perfect. That's good. Now, notions of credit card transactions. I know that you sent that this morning.

**Jdawson:** That.

**Accounting:** Jose, thank you. How is the calendar and timesheets going there?

**Bclymer:** Oh, you mean. I think we're done.

**Accounting:** EI Notion. So credit card transactions, you already sent them this morning, correct? Yes, the transactions. Okay, that's good. And then how is the calendar in Notion? Is everything updated?

**Bclymer:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. We have now pending to include like accounting for tracking and yes, it's updated.

**Jdawson:** Okay, perfect.

**Accounting:** So that's good.

**Jdawson:** Okay.

**Accounting:** Something else that you guys are missing. Something specific to Jesse that he can check with you guys.

**Bclymer:** I would like to say that to Jesse. Jesse, we have one Costco for senior project manager that I'm not sure how to fix because we have two project without this Costco in Goodwill Bloomington, we don't have a senior project manager. And so this is a REM additional payment that we need to post. But yeah, this.

**Fnjie:** So Nick Jepson is the PM on that one. Which I thought if you post a charge in Acumatica, it automatically creates the cost code in Job Planner and then they just need to put money in the budget for it. Are you saying that Acumatica won't process. Process it?

**Jdawson:** No, so at some point there were a lot of things hidden. The wrong codes in acumatica. So I instructed the team to not push anything through if they get that notification saying there's no money in the budget just to avoid things hitting the wrong code. The wrong code. So now we don't push anything through if we get that notification in Acumatica. But. But if you are saying that we should. And yeah, if you can, you can send us something in, write in. We can.

**Fnjie:** Yeah. And is it only you if there's no money in it, you don't push it through. Or if the code's not created.

**Jdawson:** If the code is not created.

**Bclymer:** Yeah.

**Fnjie:** Yeah. I don't know if it. I wish I. I don't know if it makes it. I don't think it's a problem because I think you just have to. Then they just have to go in and put a budget amount in there, do a budget modification. So I would just push it through.

**Jdawson:** Okay.

**Bclymer:** Okay.

**Accounting:** Okay. Anything else, guys, you need from Jesse? Jesse, anything you need from us as well?

**Fnjie:** I can't think of anything.

**Accounting:** Okay. Okay, guys. So you know, Brandon is a little bit busy, but if you need him, just send him a message. He will reply. Thank you. Don't forget to update everything. And then. Yeah, thank you guys for your one thing.

**Fnjie:** One thing again, like, you know, we talked last month, you know, we're trying to get everyone on that calendar schedule of all sub pay apps are done by the 25th. All owner billings are done by the first. So. And again, I guess is Fritzi, is that you or is that Fatima, like who's kind of, you know. And you can get with Ashley now. You can notify her like, hey, tell Jesse like we're missing these billings or there's these sub pay apps that are still open.

**Jdawson:** Okay, so. So Ashley is basically your. A part of your admin team, like the project team?

**Fnjie:** Yeah.

**Jdawson:** Okay. Yes. Okay. Okay. All right, good to know. So once we start, once they start posting the progress billings, we'll start tracking and using the same sheet we. We did we used before. And we'll just kind of maybe send like a daily update and include Ashley just so she can see what's posted and what's not or if we need to chase anybody, we'll just keep, you know, keep her cc'd in that.

**Fnjie:** Okay, but I mean, again, it's like, are you guys actually going in there on the 25th and checking that all the subs billings are either approved or rejected?

**Jdawson:** Yes, we can if you want us to. We Will.

**Fnjie:** Okay, yeah. I mean, that would help. And then you can just notify me and Ashley and then Cheek and Bird Dog getting everyone done. And then if you know, billing to do the last, you know, the last day of the month, but if that happens on a Saturday or a Sunday, then by Friday, they need to be done.

**Jdawson:** They need to be done.

**Fnjie:** Okay, back that up a day before that where it'd be nice to know how many people have got them done at least a day early. So, like, if that's the calendar where you guys are checking and telling me and Ashley that, hey, it's. We got two days left to get our billing in this month, and we only got three of them in. And then we can start pressuring everyone else that hasn't turned them in.

**Jdawson:** Okay, but I can't wait till the.

**Fnjie:** Last day and then try to get them all to get them done if I don't have any time left.

**Jdawson:** Okay, so I'm going to add a meeting. I'm going to add a reminder. Well, I don't think I can. On you guys calendar. Maria, can you put something on me and Fritz's calendar and add Jose to it. Add a reminder to check subcontract billings on the 25th of every month. Okay, we'll do. Yes, please. Thank you. And when. What is. I know there's one in there for the. The owner billings. What is the date for the owner billings? Jesse?

**Fnjie:** So they need to be done by whatever the last day of the month.

**Jdawson:** Is by the last day of the month.

**Fnjie:** But in this case, the last day of the month is Sunday, the 31st. So Friday would be the 29th is actually the last day they had to turn in their owner billing.

**Jdawson:** Okay.

**Fnjie:** Which means the 28th. I need to be notified. Like, who's not done yet.

**Jdawson:** Oh, okay. So you need to know the day.

**Fnjie:** Before, the day before they're due. Yeah. And that's going to fall on different days each month, depending on, like, September, the last day on a Tuesday, you know.

**Jdawson:** Okay, so for August, we need to let you know by Friday, the 29th. I mean, by Thursday. For the subcontract billings, we need to let you know by actually the end of this week, the 22nd. By Friday, you need to know who has entered it and who hasn't.

**Fnjie:** Right?

**Jdawson:** Yeah. Okay, Pritzy, can you make a note of that also, please? Yes, F. So by Friday, we need to let Jesse know who has or hasn't entered their subcontract billings or not.

**Fnjie:** That they're approved. They should be approved. And Closed out. So we know there's no more cost coming in. And I'm typically used to, like accounting just shuts down sub billings by the 25th. And that's lenient because everywhere before it was the 20th, the subs had to be done billing or else they lost out. They couldn't bill till the following cycle, the following month. But it allows us to make sure we're not going to get. We're going to do an owner billing and we got, you know, we're billing enough. That's the whole purpose of it. So.

**Jdawson:** Okay, all right, we can shut a camera. So to where, but we can't stop Job Planner.

**Fnjie:** Right.

**Jdawson:** So that's the, that's the only, only thing.

**Aortiz:** Who is preparing the Subcon building? Is it the vendor or the project manager?

**Fnjie:** The vendor supposed to. And as long as Job Planner is set up properly, then that's why they need to have that person at each sub that does their billing. And they're, they're shown as that person in Job Planner. And then in the settings for that person, they're. You allow them to create and modify invoices, and when that's set up, it's all on them, like to go in and get their billings done. So the PMs. At that point, all they should be doing is, you know, sometimes I knew there was subs that had done work, they wanted to get paid and they weren't getting me a billing. And I would notify them like, hey, get your billing in. You're going to lose the opportunity to bill this month as a courtesy. But our policies, they have to bill by the 25th, so, you know, it's all on them. But if it's not set up correctly, then you got to manually invite them to bid and, or invite them to bill and all that. It's kind of a pain.

**Jdawson:** Okay.

**Accounting:** Okay, guys. Anything else?

**Jdawson:** No, I think that's it.

**Fnjie:** All right, thank you.

**Accounting:** Thank you, guys. Talk to you later.

**Bclymer:** Thank you.

**Accounting:** Bye bye.

**Jdawson:** All right, thank you. Bye bye.

**Bclymer:** Okay.
