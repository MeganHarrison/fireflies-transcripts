## Transcript
**Ahuettl**: Hey, everybody.
**James.manhart**: A.J.
**James.manhart**: what's going on?
**Sclevenger**: Morning.
**Ahuettl**: I'm sure you guys all haven't had too much time to look at it.
**Sclevenger**: But.
**Ahuettl**: We did start on Monday.
**Ahuettl**: I still do not have a building permit.
**Ahuettl**: I stopped by the city yesterday to drop off a check for another project.
**Ahuettl**: And yeah, it's just a matter of them clicking a button.
**Ahuettl**: So we went ahead and started yesterday.
**Ahuettl**: I know times of the essence.
**Ahuettl**: So Alex is there on site.
**Ahuettl**: We got Alex.
**Ahuettl**: Do we have that first pole cut?
**Connie**: Sure do.
**Sclevenger**: Okay, so.
**Ahuettl**: So with that opening now in the front, guys, we'll be able to start getting our material in.
**Ahuettl**: We already have all of our, our framing material.
**Ahuettl**: It's been bought for a while.
**Ahuettl**: So that, that's getting loaded in today.
**Ahuettl**: And we're going to go ahead and get going on framing that demising wall.
**Ahuettl**: Critical path, that's what we need to get up.
**Ahuettl**: We'll frame the exterior walls.
**Ahuettl**: And you know, it's nice that that other adjacent space is unfinished.
**Sclevenger**: So.
**Ahuettl**: You know, we're gonna start hanging that one side of the FedEx side.
**Neil.cardenas**: As soon as possible so we can.
**Ahuettl**: Get that ceiling done and get out of FedEx's way.
**Ahuettl**: So here in the next couple weeks as, as we start progressing, I'll be sending a weekly report out starting this Friday with photos.
**Ahuettl**: And being the tight timeline that we're on to try to get FedEx in.
**Neil.cardenas**: There as soon as possible.
**Ahuettl**: I'm going to be sending a two week look ahead as well.
**Ahuettl**: That kind of gives you a rundown of what we're doing each day.
**Ahuettl**: So what, we'll have some guys on top of each other, but we're going to try our best to get this thing knocked out quickly.
**Bclymer**: AJ I did look at it this morning, top to bottom.
**Bclymer**: Looks really good.
**Bclymer**: Appreciate the, the timeline I went ahead and switched us.
**Bclymer**: The original turnover date inside of FedEx's system was 9, 8.
**Bclymer**: I believe it was the two weeks prior to what you have.
**Bclymer**: So I went ahead and switched theirs to what you gave me.
**Bclymer**: It.
**Bclymer**: We're not beholden to that, of course, but at least, let's at least lets them inside know what they're doing.
**Bclymer**: Try and get their ordering times and dates together so they can make sure their stuff arrives when they've got somebody there that can, that could deal with it.
**Connie**: Right.
**Ahuettl**: I appreciate that, James.
**Ahuettl**: Yeah, we're like I said, that's, that's really tight and that's with guys working on top of each other.
**Ahuettl**: We don't like to schedule it this way, but you know, we want to do Good.
**Ahuettl**: A good job to try.
**Ahuettl**: Try our best to get you guys.
**Neil.cardenas**: In there as soon as possible.
**Ahuettl**: So just unfortunate it's taken so long to get this amendment done, but now that we're here, we're gonna manage it well and get it done quickly for you.
**Bclymer**: So, yeah, welcome to city politics.
**Ahuettl**: Yeah, I mean, man, I.
**Ahuettl**: Look, I. I live in Carmel, so it's pretty much in my backyard, and I've done quite a bit of work.
**Ahuettl**: It's been, you know, two years probably since my last project in Carmel city limits.
**Ahuettl**: And this is the longest it's taken ever.
**Ahuettl**: So it's.
**Ahuettl**: It's pretty unfortunate.
**Ahuettl**: But they like the way their exterior buildings look, and everybody wants to have a say.
**Ahuettl**: So I think I had to go through 30 different people for the amendment is what my log showed for them to check a box and say it's okay.
**Ahuettl**: But now that we're here, we'll get her done.
**Bclymer**: Yes, sir.
**Ahuettl**: Do you guys have any questions from a FedEx standpoint?
**Ahuettl**: You know, James, at some point just want to chat about where we're going to be leaving.
**Ahuettl**: Our.
**Ahuettl**: Our electricians giving you junction boxes so your electricians can come in and connect everything.
**Ahuettl**: And I just want a little clarity on what we're going to leave you in the ceiling.
**Ahuettl**: I think you guys have some power polls that are coming in.
**Ahuettl**: So as we get closer here in the next two weeks, be expecting some email communication on that, and then also be expecting some email communication on that separate sign permit.
**Ahuettl**: And I'll make sure I keep everybody in the loop on that.
**Ahuettl**: So it was approved.
**Ahuettl**: The blade sign was approved.
**Ahuettl**: The locations were approved.
**Ahuettl**: But still do have to pull that sign permit.
**Ahuettl**: And I've already filled out the application, but I'll keep you guys in the loop with the actual approver.
**Ahuettl**: Her name's Elisa.
**Ahuettl**: And I'll put an email together just to follow up with her here in the next week if I don't see any movement.
**Bclymer**: Okay, just make sure you copy Molly and them on that.
**Ahuettl**: Okay.
**Ahuettl**: You want me to include Kelly as well?
**Bclymer**: Yes, please.
**James.manhart**: Okay.
**James.manhart**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And then of course, myself and Neil.
**Ahuettl**: Yeah, gotcha.
**Ahuettl**: Okay, well, that's all I have.
**James.manhart**: What's this?
**Connie**: What's the status of FedEx pursuit of their TI permits?
**Ahuettl**: So I. I've been.
**Ahuettl**: I've been talking with Molly and I. I really don't want them to apply for a permit until I have my building permit.
**Ahuettl**: But here, if I don't have that in the next two days, I'm going to go ahead and just.
**Ahuettl**: With the turnaround Time it's taken so far, it worries me from a FedEx standpoint, you guys getting that permit done in time.
**Ahuettl**: So I think that we need to submit here at the end of this week.
**Ahuettl**: So let's just plan on that, James and Neil, and cross our fingers that I have my permit.
**Ahuettl**: I just don't want to muddy the water.
**Ahuettl**: It's taken so long to get it now.
**Ahuettl**: And then when they see another permit come through, I'm worried that's gonna raise a red flag before I actually have mine.
**Evan**: A.J.
**Evan**: this is Jesse.
**Evan**: Would that.
**Evan**: Could it possibly just push them to hit that button and approve yours?
**Evan**: They're like, at least to give you something to talk to them about.
**Evan**: Listen, like, our permits approved by everything we see, this permit needs to get submitted as quick as possible, so.
**James.manhart**: Yeah, that's.
**Ahuettl**: That's a good point.
**Ahuettl**: I'll email Nick Mishler.
**Ahuettl**: He's the coordinator, and.
**Ahuettl**: And.
**Ahuettl**: And just tell him that FedEx will be submitting, and I would.
**Ahuettl**: I. I would just go ahead and submit.
**Ahuettl**: That's a good point, Jesse.
**Ahuettl**: I'm weary of pushing them, but at this point, it's been two months, so they probably need a little push.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Neil, tell me if I'm wrong, but I was pretty sure Molly was going to send that in this week.
**Sclevenger**: Yeah, that's what I saw.
**Bclymer**: That's what I remember from the call.
**Ahuettl**: Sounds good.
**Bclymer**: That's all I got, aj.
**Connie**: Yeah, likewise.
**Connie**: We covered everything on my notes, aj okay.
**Ahuettl**: We'll expect some cool pictures this week.
**Ahuettl**: Hopefully holes in the wall and studs up, so.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Connie**: Actually just took out one of the panels from the entrance and dropped it while we were on this call into the dumpster, so.
**Ahuettl**: So, yeah, hurry up and close that up, Alex.
**Connie**: Superior's already here framing it up, so.
**Ahuettl**: Awesome.
**James.manhart**: Good deal.
**Bclymer**: Thank you, gentlemen.
**Ahuettl**: All right, guys.
**Ahuettl**: See you.
**James.manhart**: Thanks, everyone.
**James.manhart**: Thanks.
**James.manhart**: See.
